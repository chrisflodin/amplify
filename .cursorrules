## Visual Style Overview

If you are implementing a design, then implement a modern, minimalistic, and premium design, with a strong emphasis on contrast, typography, and clarity. The overall look balances business professionalism with creative flair.

- **Color Palette:** Dark background with sharp white typography. Bright, colorful visuals in case studies add contrast and personality.
- **Typography:** Large, bold sans-serif fonts with plenty of whitespace. Clear visual hierarchy and easy readability.
- **Layout:** Grid-based, modular sections (e.g., services, projects, CTA). Clean structure and intuitive navigation.
- **Tone & Feel:** Confident, result-driven, and trustworthy. Visuals and messaging target growth-minded entrepreneurs and modern brands.
- **Service Presentation:** Broad offering (branding, SEO, dev, e-commerce), presented in minimal black/white service cards.

The style signals a full-service digital agency with creative and technical edge.
